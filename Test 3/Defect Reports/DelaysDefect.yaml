Bug ID: PERFORMANCE_ BUG_002
Bug Title: Delays in Removing Items, accessing Menu Bar, and Navigation

Description: When a user interacts with the application, there are delays. 
  Removing items from the cart is slow, the menu bar takes time to load and navigation between pages is delayed, with the cart selection not updating smoothly. 
  All actions should be quick and seamless, but the delays make the app feel unresponsive.
