Bug ID: CHECKOUT_NAVIGATION_DELAY_BUG_001
Bug Title: Delay in Navigation when using Back Button

Description: When a user navigates back from the Checkout - Complete page, there is a significant delay in loading the previous page. 
  For example, after clicking the "Back" button, the user experiences a lag before the Your Cart page or Products page loads. 
  This delay disrupts the user experience and makes the navigation feel unresponsive. The expected behavior is instant navigation without delays.
