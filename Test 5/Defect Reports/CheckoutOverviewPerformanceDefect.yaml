Bug Title: Delays and Navigation Issues on Checkout Overview Page for Performance Glitch User

Description: When a user tries to complete checkout, there are delays and navigation issues. 
  After logging in and adding a product to the cart, the user reaches the Checkout - Your Information page. 
  However, when clicking Continue, the Checkout - Overview page loads slowly, and the product details take time to appear. 
  The menu bar is slow, and clicking cancel causes delays and leads to the wrong page. All actions should be quick and smooth, but these delays disrupt the user experience.
