Bug Title: Login Delay and Slow Product Page Load for Performance Glitch User

Description: When a user logs in there is a noticeable delay in authentication, taking longer than expected. Additionally, 
  after successful login, the Products page loads slowly, taking more than 5 seconds to display. 
  The expected behavior is that login should be completed instantly and the Products page should load almost instantly after authentication. 
  Instead, the user experiences lag, making navigation inefficient and frustrating.
